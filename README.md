# Azure API Center

In today’s API-first digital ecosystem, organizations are challenged with an ever-expanding network of APIs. This proliferation - known as API sprawl - poses significant challenges in API governance, security, compliance, and reuse. Without a centralized inventory, APIs can become isolated, leading to poor API reuse, lack of alignment with organizational API design and organizational processes, as well as increased vulnerability to security breaches.

**Azure API Center** provides a centralized API inventory for seamless API discovery, reuse, and governance regardless of API type, lifecycle stage, or deployment location. Azure API Center addresses a critical need for centralized API inventory, ensuring that the extraordinary growth of APIs enhances rather than hinders the development process:

- Build a complete and current catalog of all APIs - regardless of their type, stage in their lifecycle, or deployment location - to enable API discovery, consumption, and governance.

- Enable API best practices at-scale and enforce API design rules across your organization to empower API developers to create APIs in line with these standards, ensuring quality and uniformity across all APIs produced.

- Foster reusability of your APIs by enabling API consumers to quickly discover and consume the right APIs.

- Improve API producer and consumer developer experience with our Visual Studio Code extension.
