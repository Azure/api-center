# Azure API Center Preview

Microsoft Azure API Center is a new Azure service and a capability of the Azure API Management platform that enables tracking APIs in a centralized location for discovery, reuse, and governance. [Learn more about API Center](https://aka.ms/apicenter/preview/blog).

This repository serves as a collaboration space between the API Center users and the product team during the preview release. We encourage you to provide us with feedback, report bugs, and request features to help us improve the service and shape its roadmap.
